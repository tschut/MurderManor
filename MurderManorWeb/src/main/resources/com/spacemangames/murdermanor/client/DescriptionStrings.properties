rooms = bed

bed = You wake up after a good night's sleep, feeling strangely disoriented. The bed seems much bigger and softer, the sheets don't smell like your usual detergent, and you're pretty certain your digital alarm clock doesn't produce this kind of loud ticking. For a moment, you lie absolutely still while trying to figure out where you are. \
<br/><br/>Then you remember. \
<br/><br/>The storm. \
<br/><br/>Last night, you had been on your way to a quaint little cottage for a well-deserved holiday in the countryside. Halfway there, the bad weather had gradually grown into a full-on gale. The wind had started howling angrily, and hailstones the size of your thumb nail had suddenly started pelting down onto the car roof. You had been frantically trying to navigate the dark, rural roads for what had seemed like forever, when a brightly lit street light had seemingly appeared out of nowhere. By then, the hail had finally let up, but your windshield wipers barely managed to keep up with the lashing rain following it. As far as you had been able to make out, the light seemed to mark the entrance to a private road with a large manor house at the end. \
<br/><br/>You had driven up the wide entrance road to the manor and had defied the storm to ask for shelter. Even the short walk up to the front door had drenched and chilled you to the bone. The door had been opened by a butler in full dress, white gloves and all, ushering you in. The manor owner, who had turned out to be a kind, yet eccentric man of about 60 years old. You had enjoyed a nice glass of brandy together to warm you up, and then the maid had shown you to your room for the night. \
<br/><br/>While you lie contemplating the previous night's ordeals, a piercing scream suddenly disturbs the peaceful morning.
